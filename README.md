# Display Coordinates in FiveM

This Lua script for the FiveM game displays the player's coordinates on the screen, and allows the user to toggle the display on and off with the /coords command.
Additionally, the script displays the player's id and name above his head.

## Usage

To use this script in your FiveM server, follow these steps:

1. Copy the contents of client.lua to a new file in your resources directory.
2. Add the following line to your server.cfg file: start <name of your new resource directory>
3. Start your FiveM server.

In the game, the user can turn the coordinate display on and off with the /coords command.
